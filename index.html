Hi!
</p>
</br>
<p>
My name is Lee Glicklich and I am an undergraduate student at Tufts University. I am currently majoring in Economics and minoring in Communications & Mass Media Studies.
</p>

<div class="about-text">
<p>

<ul> 
<br />
<p><strong>At Tufts: </strong></p>
<li>
I am a dedicated member of the Tufts Entertainment Board, a student organization responsible for school-wide entertainment events including comedy shows, festivals, topical lectures and sporting trips. I identify opportunities to advertise upcoming events through both traditional and digital media. I am also the event photographer for our various social media channels including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. In the past, we have had the honor to host renowned lectures and comedians, including Jeffrey Tambor and Kenan Thompson.
</li>
<li>
I am a proud brother of the Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity. I specifically work with the communications committee to raise campus, community, and alumnae relations, as well as aid in the development of a new website. You can access our Tufts SigEp Massachussetts Zeta Chapter Website Here: http://tuftssigep.com
</li>
<li>
I am a trained vocalist and vocal percussionist for Tufts sQ!, an auditioned co-ed acapella group on campus. We partake in on-campus and off-campus performances and competitions. Additionally, I assist with composing musical arrangements and advertising upcoming events.
</li>
</ul>

<br />
<p><strong>Back in CT: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
I was a summer intern in 2014 for The Ridgefield Playhouse, a non-profit performing arts venue that hosts national and local acts for the community of Ridgefield, CT and the surrounding area.  I worked with the Marketing Manager and the Chief Development Officer to assist with community outreach, hospitality and marketing strategies.
</li>
<li>
I went to High School at Greens Farms Academy in Greens Farms, CT where I was on Student Council for four consecutive years. I was a hard working class representative from 2010-2012, and was honored to be class president in 2013.
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><strong>Rowing/Crew </strong></p>
<ul>
<li> 
From 2009-2013, I was a member of the Saugatuck Rowing Club Varsity team where I rowed on various boats ranging from singles, doubles, quads, fours, and heavyweight eights. I qualified and competed in Youth National Championships my junior and senior year of high school, as well as Youth Club Nationals every Summer. I had the privilege to lead the team to success as Varsity Captain during the 2013-2014 Fall, Spring, and Summer seasons. I've brought my experience to the Tufts University Varsity team in the Fall of 2013, where I've rowed in NESCAC competitions. Unfortunately, my lower back is currently injured and I am taking some time off of the sport to rehabilitate and restore my strength.
